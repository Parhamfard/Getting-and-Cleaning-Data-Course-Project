# Code Book

It has the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.The final summary tidy dataset "tidydata.txt" contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set

## Description

Code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data
run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project’s definition:
        
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.


Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones 
Data in dataset contains 180 rows and 68 columns for 

•mean(): Mean value

•std(): Standard deviation


## Identifiers 

The base data is grouped by the following values to build mean value and the standard deviation std()

•subject - The ID of the test subject

•activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken


## Activity

Assign each data to variables:

Activity.Test  <- read.table
Activity.Train <- read.table
Subject.Train <- read.table
Subject.Test  <- read.table
Features.Test  <- read.table
Features.Train <- read.table

# Merge test and train with combine method

data.Subject <- rbind(Subject.Train, Subject.Test)

data.Activity<- rbind(Activity.Train, Activity.Test)

data.Features<- rbind(Features.Train, Features.Test)

#set new variables

names(data.Subject)<-c("subject")

names(data.Activity)<- c("activity")

Features.Names <- read.table(file.path("~/UCI HAR Dataset", "features.txt"),head=FALSE)

names(data.Features)<- Features.Names$V2

data.Combine <- cbind(data.Subject, data.Activity)

# Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement 

Data <- cbind(data.Features, data.Combine)

New.Features.Names<-Features.Names$V2[grep("mean\\(\\)|std\\(\\)", Features.Names$V2)]

New.Names<-c(as.character(New.Features.Names), "subject", "activity" )

Data<-subset(Data,select=New.Names)

#Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Entire numbers in code column of the TidyData replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable

#Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names code column in TidyData renamed into activities

#Alocate descriptive name

prefix t is replaced by time
Acc is replaced by Accelerometer
Gyro is replaced by Gyroscope
prefix f is replaced by frequency
Mag is replaced by Magnitude
BodyBody is replaced by Body

names(Data)<-gsub("^t", "time", names(Data))

names(Data)<-gsub("^f", "frequency", names(Data))

names(Data)<-gsub("Acc", "Accelerometer", names(Data))

names(Data)<-gsub("Gyro", "Gyroscope", names(Data))

names(Data)<-gsub("Mag", "Magnitude", names(Data))

names(Data)<-gsub("BodyBody", "Body", names(Data))

From the data set in above step, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

Final.Data (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing TidyData taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.

The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project’s definition.
