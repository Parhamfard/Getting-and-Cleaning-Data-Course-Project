==================================================================
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
======================================
Dataset
======================================
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones.

The CodeBook.md file:
=========================================
A code book describes the variables and their names, the data, and transformations on the data.

run_analysis.R:
=========================================

Data preparation in 5 steps:


1. Combine the training and the test data sets to create one data set.
2. Calculate the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive method to name the activities in the data set
4. labling the data set with descriptive variable new names.
5. Create a tidy data set from previous step including the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 
Tidy data.txt 
=========================================
A tidy data export as a result of the last step of the above procedure in a txt format.
